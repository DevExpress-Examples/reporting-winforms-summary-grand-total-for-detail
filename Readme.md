# Reporting for WinForms - How to Calculate Grand Total for Detail Report Summaries


This example calculates grand total summary for detail reports.

In this example, the report is bound to a dataset that has two related tables - the `Customers` table for the main report, and the `Orders` table for the DetailReport band. 

The detail report calculates the sum of the `Freight` columns for each customer. This summary is calculated automatically in the `xrlFreightTotal` label in the detail report footer.

The grand total of the `Freight` summaries is displayed in the main report. This summary cannot be calculated automatically, because the `Freight` column does not belong to the main report data source. To solve the problem, the [SummaryCalculated](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XRLabel.SummaryCalculated) event of summary labels in a detail report is handled. Note that when the `BeforePrint` event occurs, a summary value is not yet calculated. Use the `SummaryCalculated` event to obtain a calculated summary value. The summary amounts of the individual detailed reports are summed up in a global variable (`GrandTotals`), which is then printed in the footer of the main report.
